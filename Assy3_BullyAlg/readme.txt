To run the code, do the following:
1- specify the peer information in cluster.txt
2- for each peer, run the code using the following command:

    go run peer.go <num> <location of config file>

For example, to start peer 0; first in cluster.txt that resides in the same directory as peer.go:
    go run peer.go 0 cluster.txt



Happy debugging!
